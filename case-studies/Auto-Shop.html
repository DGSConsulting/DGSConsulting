    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
      <p>When I first met <strong>Mike</strong>, the owner of a busy auto repair shop in Ontario, he was on the verge of burnout. His shop had a strong reputation and a steady flow of customers, yet Mike felt like he was drowning in chaos. He was working long hours, often late into the evening, and still couldn’t seem to get ahead.</p>
      <p>“It feels like I spend more time babysitting systems than growing my business,” Mike told me. His seven technicians were doing great work in the bays, but behind the scenes, inefficiency was quietly draining profits.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Problem -->
    <section class="problem">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Hidden Money Drain</h2>
      <p>At first glance, everything looked fine. The shop was full, bills were paid, and customers were happy. But once we dug deeper, the real issue emerged: the techs were finishing jobs only to spend <strong>15–20 minutes</strong> manually updating three disconnected systems:</p>
      <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li>A scheduling tool that constantly fell out of sync</li>
        <li>An inventory tracker requiring manual adjustments</li>
        <li>An invoicing platform that didn’t integrate with either</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Multiply that by <strong>8–10 jobs a day</strong> and seven employees, and the numbers became staggering. Over <strong>120 payroll hours each month</strong> were wasted on administrative work — the equivalent of a full-time salary spent on redundant data entry.</p>
      <p>Worse, these inefficiencies weren’t just costing money. They were slowing down job turnover, frustrating staff, and reducing the shop’s capacity to serve more customers.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Solution -->
    <section class="solution">
      <h2 class="section-title">A Simple Fix With Big Impact</h2>
      <p>We approached this project with a clear philosophy: <em>don’t disrupt what’s working — enhance it.</em> The goal wasn’t to reinvent Mike’s business, but to remove the friction points holding it back.</p>
      <p>Our process unfolded in three phases:</p>
      <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li><strong>Observation & Mapping:</strong> We shadowed the team for two full days, documenting every step of the workflow from vehicle check-in to final invoicing. This gave us a true, ground-level understanding of where time was being lost.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Tool Selection:</strong> Rather than jumping to expensive “all-in-one” software, we carefully evaluated options and chose a solution that integrated seamlessly with the shop’s existing systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Hands-On Training:</strong> A short, two-hour interactive session got the entire team aligned and comfortable with the new tools. No lengthy manuals, no over-complication — just practical, relevant training.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The end result was a streamlined process where jobs closed with just a few clicks, inventory updated automatically, and invoicing happened in real time. For the technicians, it felt almost invisible — like the paperwork had just… disappeared.</p>
    </section>

      <h2 class="section-title">The Results</h2>
      <p>The changes weren’t just felt — they were measured. Within 30 days of implementation, Mike’s shop saw dramatic improvements across the board.</p>
      <div class="results-grid">
        <div class="result-card">
          <div class="result-number">2–3</div>
          <div class="result-text">Hours saved weekly per technician</div>
        </div>
        <div class="result-card">
          <div class="result-number">$1–2K</div>
          <div class="result-text">Monthly operating costs reduced</div>
        </div>
        <div class="result-card">
          <div class="result-number">$10–20K</div>
          <div class="result-text">Kept in business annually</div>

    <section class="lessons">
      <h2 class="section-title">Key Lessons for Other Businesses</h2>
      <p>This case study isn’t just about one auto shop — it highlights a pattern seen across many small businesses:</p>
      <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li><strong>Technology should work for you, not against you.</strong> Fancy tools are worthless if your team won’t use them.</li>
        <li><strong>Small changes compound quickly.</strong> Saving just a few minutes per task can lead to tens of thousands of dollars annually.</li>
        <li><strong>Observe before you act.</strong> Understanding the reality of day-to-day operations is critical before selecting systems or tools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For Mike, these lessons meant less stress, happier employees, and a healthier bottom line. For other business owners, they serve as a roadmap to uncovering hidden profit that’s been there all along.</p>
