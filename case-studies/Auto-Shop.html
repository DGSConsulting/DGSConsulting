  <!-- Case Study Content -->
  <div class="case-content">

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
      <p>When I first met <strong>Mike</strong>, the owner of a busy auto repair shop in Ottawa, his business was thriving on the surface. The bays were always full, customers loved the service, and revenue was steady. But behind the scenes, Mike was burning out. He was buried under endless administrative tasks and spending late nights catching up on paperwork.</p>
      <p>“It feels like I spend more time fixing systems than fixing cars,” he said during our first meeting. His team of seven technicians were excellent at their craft, but too much of their day was spent fighting with disconnected tools and manual processes.</p>
      <p>Mike wasn’t just losing time — he was losing money, and he didn’t even realize how much.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Problem -->
    <section class="problem">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Problem: A Silent Profit Killer</h2>
      <p>At a glance, Mike’s shop looked efficient. But when we observed the workflow, we uncovered a hidden drain on both time and profits.</p>
      <p>Each time a repair was completed, technicians spent <strong>15–20 minutes</strong> bouncing between three disconnected systems to update job statuses, parts inventory, and invoicing.</p>
      <p>This might not seem like much, but multiplied across <strong>8–10 jobs per day</strong> and seven employees, it added up to over <strong>120 payroll hours per month</strong>. That’s the equivalent of paying a full-time salary just to move data from one place to another.</p>
      <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li>A scheduling tool that constantly went out of sync</li>
        <li>Inventory tracking that required manual updates</li>
        <li>An invoicing platform with no direct connection to the others</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The result? Frustrated technicians, slower turnaround times, and missed opportunities to take on more customers.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Solution -->
    <section class="solution">
      <h2 class="section-title">The Solution: Integrating Smart, Simple Tools</h2>
      <p>The heart of the solution was a seamless integration between <strong>Shopmonkey</strong> and <strong>QuickBooks Online</strong>. Shopmonkey became the operational hub, managing scheduling, repair orders, and technician workflows. QuickBooks handled financial tracking and synced automatically with Shopmonkey for invoices and payments.</p>
      <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li>Jobs closed in under 2 minutes instead of 15–20</li>
        <li>Inventory updates automatically</li>
        <li>Financial reporting in real time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, Mike’s team could focus on what they do best: fixing cars.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Key Lessons for Small Businesses</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-points">
        <li><strong>Integrate, don’t replace.</strong> Connecting the right tools can be more effective than starting over.</li>
        <li><strong>Every minute matters.</strong> Small inefficiencies add up to big losses over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Match tools to people.</strong> Software works best when it fits naturally into existing workflows.</li>
        <li><strong>Observe before acting.</strong> Real improvements come from understanding the current process first.</li>
