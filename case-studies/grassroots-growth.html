      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This case study highlights how a small, community-based company leveraged 
        digital tools to overcome operational bottlenecks and unlock growth. 
        With limited resources, they needed a way to scale without burning out their team.

      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The client faced three core issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manual processes were eating into valuable time</li>
        <li>Sales opportunities were slipping through the cracks</li>
        <li>Lack of clear visibility made decision-making reactive instead of proactive</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Working closely with the business owner, I implemented a set of practical 
        digital tools tailored to their workflow. Key actions included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introducing an integrated CRM to track leads and customer interactions</li>
        <li>Automating routine scheduling and reporting tasks</li>
        <li>Setting up dashboards to provide real-time visibility into operations</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        Within the first year of adopting these changes, the company saw measurable improvements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>100% revenue growth</strong> — sales doubled year-over-year</li>
        <li><strong>40% less admin time</strong> — freeing up staff for higher-value work</li>
        <li><strong>Stronger customer relationships</strong> — thanks to timely follow-ups and better communication</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
      <p>
        Small businesses don’t need massive budgets or complex systems to scale. 
        The right digital tools, applied with intention, can unlock growth and 
        create more breathing room for owners and teams alike.
